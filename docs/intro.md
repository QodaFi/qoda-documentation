# Introduction

<p style={{ color: "red" }}>*****NOTE: The documentation page is under constant development. Please check back frequently for updates.*****</p>

The Qoda protocol is a lending/borrowing protocol built on Moonbeam. It has three key features:

1. Fixed interest rate, fixed maturity loans
2. Marketplace model
3. Focus on parachain token and altcoin denominated loans

# Why Fixed Interest Rates?

Fixed interest rates are the basis of developed interest rates market. In traditional finance, fixed interest rates are overwhelmingly preferred by users over floating interest rates. The reason for this is fixed rates means reduced volatility. Lenders want stable yield, and borrowers want predictable cost of borrow.

On top of that, having fixed interest rate deals recorded on-chain introduces the possibility for a new DeFi primitive - the Crypto Yield Curve. The yield curve is a fundamental building block of fixed income on top of which various rich and complex products can be built. If the goal is to promote the growth of a vibrant, mature crypto interest rate market, fixed rates is the place to start.

# Why Marketplace?

The Marketplace mechanism allows users to set their own terms on their loans by publishing orders, which we call Quotes, specifying terms such as whether they are a borrower or lender, the size of the loan, when it matures, and what is their desired APR. This can all be done off-chain trustlessly via cryptographic digital signatures so that users don't need to pay any gas when publishing Quotes. Alternatively, users can also browse the list of existing Quotes in the Marketplace, and pick the terms that suit their needs.

# Altcoin Loans

Because of the increase in efficiency of price discovery and capital allocation with the Marketplace model, Qoda can give a better offering of lending/borrowing in various parachain tokens. This means more opportunity to earn fixed yield or borrow at a fixed cost for your tokens in the Polkadot ecosystem.
