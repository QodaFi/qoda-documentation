# Introduction

The Qoda protocol is a fixed interest rate lending/borrowing marketplace built on Moonbeam.

# Why Fixed Interest Rates?

Fixed interest rates are the basis of developed interest rates market. In traditional finance, fixed interest rates are overwhelmingly preferred by users over floating interest rates. The reason for this is fixed rates means reduced volatility. Lenders want stable yield, and borrowers want predictable cost of borrow.

On top of that, having fixed interest rate deals recorded on-chain introduces the possibility for a new DeFi primitive - the Crypto Yield Curve. The yield curve is a fundamental building block of fixed income on top of which various rich and complex products can be built. If the goal is to promote the growth of a vibrant, mature crypto interest rate market, fixed rates is the place to start.
