## Account Health

The `Account Health` is a measure of how close your account is to being liquidated. An `Account Health` below 1.0 may be liquidated at any time. The `Account Health` is a ratio of the account's `Collateral Factor`-adjusted collateral value (in USD) divided by the `Market Factor`-adjusted net borrow value (in USD). Click [here](/whitepaper/qoda-protocol#25-collateral-management) for a deeper, more technical explanation on `Account Health`. 

## APR

The Annual Percentage Rate is the simple interest rate paid from the borrower to the lender normalized over one year. This lets lenders/borrowers easily compare the interest rate of one loan versus another even if they might have different `Maturity` times.

Example: Suppose the APR is 10%, and that the lender lends 100 USDC to the borrower. 

- After 30 days, the lender will accrue 100 \` (10% \` 30 / 365) = 0.82 USDC of interest.
- After 180 days, the lender will accrue 100 \` (10% \` 180 / 365) = 4.93 USDC of interest. 
- After 365 days, the lender will accrue 100 \` (10% \` 365 / 365) = 10 USDC of interest.

## Borrow Value

The `Borrow Value` is the aggregated value of all borrows across all `Markets` of an account in USD as determined by the latest Chainlink oracle price.

## Collateral Factor

The `Collateral Factor` is a number from 0-100% assigned to every `Asset` that represents a weighting of how much lesser the Qoda collateral system will value collateral posted in that `Asset` from its current market price due, to the perceived market risk of the collateral.

Generally, large, liquid, safer `Assets` have high `Collateral Factors`, while small, illiquid, riskier `Assets` have low `Collateral Factors`. If an Asset has a 0% `Collateral Factor`, it canâ€™t be used as collateral, though it can still be lent or borrowed in Qoda `Markets`.

## Collateral Value (Real Collateral Value)

The `Collateral Value` (or `Real Collateral Value`) is the aggregated value of all collateral an account has deposited in USD as determined by the latest Chainlink oracle price.

## Lend Value

The `Lend Value` is the aggregated value of all lends across all `Markets` of an account in USD as determined by the latest Chainlink oracle price.

## Market

A `Market` is the place where users can borrow or lend. A `Market` is made up of two components:

1. `Underlying ERC20 Token`, which is the token which is being borrowed or lent.
2. `Maturity`, which is when borrowers must repay their loans, and when lenders may redeem their `qTokens` for the underlying token.

The naming convention of `Market`s is [TOKEN SYMBOL][MONTH][YEAR]. For example, the USDCJUL22 `Market` is where users may borrow or lend USDC tokens, maturing on 29th July 2022, 4:00 PM UTC.

Important to note: When a borrower repays their loan, they are repaying to the `Market` smart contract. And when a lender is redeeming their repayments, they are receiving it from the `Market` smart contract. This is a subtle point which differentiates Qoda from a direct peer-to-peer model, and allows for greater capital efficiency! This allows borrowing and lending to be interpreted as inverses of each other. If you lent from a `Market`, you can effectively close your loan early by borrowing the same amount (or vice versa, if you were originally borrowing), rather than having to wait the full term for the loan to mature.

## Market Factor

The `Market Factor` is a number from 0-100% assigned to every `Market` that represents a weighting of how much more the Qoda collateral system will value the amount a user has borrowed in that `Market` from its current market price, due to the perceived market risk of the underlying token.

Generally, large, liquid, safer `Markets` have high `Market Factors`, while small, illiquid, risker `Markets` have low `Market Factors`.

## Maturity

The `Maturity` time is the time after which a `Market` closes. No `Quotes` may be published or accepted after the `Maturity` time. This is also the time when borrowers need to repay their loans. By convention, the `Maturity` time is set to be the last business day of the month at 4:00 PM UTC.

## mToken Wrapping / Unwrapping

Users must deposit collateral on Qoda before they can borrow. However, letting users' collateral simply sit inside the Qoda vault doing nothing is capital inefficient. Hence, Qoda gives users the option to allow their collateral to be deposited into [Moonwell.fi](https://moonwell.fi/)'s money markets to earn interest for them. Qoda will automatically handle the conversion of user collateral into Moonwell's equivalent interest-bearing tokens, as well as automatically handle converting the interest-bearing tokens back to the underlying collateral plus the interest you've accrued when you request for withdrawal.

NOTE: Using external contracts such as Moonwell includes smart contract risk that is outside of the control of the Qoda Protocol. Please make sure you understand all the risks associated with using Moonwell's money markets. Users can always opt out of wrapping their collateral in money markets if they do not wish to do so.

## qToken

Each `Market` has an associated `qToken`, which is minted to a user when they lend to the `Market`. `qTokens` represent the full principal plus interest amount that the user may redeem when the `Market` matures. For example: 

> *A user lends 100 GLMR at all-in fixed rate of 10%, expiring on 31 March, 2022. When the transaction is executed, the system will mint 110 qGLMRMAR22 tokens to the user. Upon the expiry of the contract on 31st March 4:00pm UTC, the 110 qGLMRMAR22 tokens will be redeemable for the underlying 110 GLMR tokens at a 1:1 rate.*

The advantage of `qTokens` is that it allows for greater capital allocation efficiency. While the user can simply hold onto them, the `qTokens` themselves hold value and can potentially be traded in secondary markets, staked in yield farms, used as collateral itself in other protocols, etc.

Note that a user may not have an outstanding debt and hold `qTokens` at the same time. If a user holding `qTokens` borrows in the same `Market`, the balance of the loan will be deducted from the `qTokens`. If `qTokens` are transferred to a user with an outstanding loan, the balance of the loan will be deducted first and the user will only receive `qTokens` that are in excess of their current borrows.

## Quote

`Quotes` are Qoda's off-chain orders using digital signatures to either lend or borrow a particular token for a user-specified size, APR, and maturity date. You can think of `Quotes` as an analogue to limit orders in an orderbook. Users can either publish `Quotes` into the platform and wait for others to execute against it, or they can browse the list of existing `Quotes` and pick the terms that suit their needs.

## Repayment Redemption Ratio (RRR)

Qoda adopts a hybrid overcollateralized/undercollateralized loan system. Because a portion of borrowers are undercollateralized, in catastrophic situations there is the possibility of borrower nonpayment. How will redemptions for lenders work in the case of bad debt? In traditional finance, this situation typically triggers a bank run, where lenders all try to redeem at the same time. The first few lucky lenders to redeem can receive 100% of funds, while the late redeemers receive 0%.

Qoda implements a `Repayment Redemption Ratio` (RRR) system. The repayment ratio, which is the real-time ratio of total amount that borrowers have repaid divided by the total amount that lenders are owed, is displayed transparently by the protocol at all times. In the event of a borrower default, losses are socialized among lenders to ensure fairness to all users.

> *Example: The USDCSEP22 market has just expired. Lenders have lent 1,000,000 USDC in total, while borrowers have only repaid 600,000 USDC. The `Repayment Ratio` is 60%, so all lenders can redeem only 50% of their qUSDCSEP22 qTokens. If a lender has 100 qUSDCSEP22 qTokens, they will only be able to redeem for 60 USDC. The remaining 40 qUSDCSEP22 qTokens will still remain in their wallet. In the event that borrowers are later able to make payment, they will be able to redeem the remaining 40 qUSDCSEP22 for the underlying USDC.*

## Virtual Borrow Value

The `Virtual Borrow Value` is the `Market Factor-`adjusted aggregated value in USD (as determined by the current Chainlink oracle price) of all net borrows (i.e. borrows minus lends) across all markets, where each borrowed `Market` is adjusted by its corresponding `Market Factor`. Important to note is that for any particular `Market`, a net positive lend position does not reduce the aggregate `Virtual Borrow Value` - that is, lending in a `Market` is not equivalent to depositing collateral. Lending in a `Market` cannot substitute as collateral, it can only net against a positive borrow position in that particular `Market`.

Note that the `Virtual Borrow Value` is always greater than or equal to the `Real Borrow Value`.

## Virtual Collateral Value

The `Virtual Collateral Value` is the `Collateral Factor-`adjusted aggregated value in USD (as determined by the current Chainlink oracle price) of all collateral an account has deposited, where each collateral `Asset` is adjusted by its corresponding `Collateral Factor`. Note that the `Virtual Collateral Value` is always less than or equal to the `Real Collateral Value`.
