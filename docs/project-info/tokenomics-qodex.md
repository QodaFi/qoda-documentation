# QODEX Tokenomics (archived)

Qoda’s deployment on the Moonriver network has followed the spirit of the Kusama ecosystem: move fast and experiment. This canary deployment and its accompanying QODEX token have been an eye-opening experience for our team. We learned how to run fully decentralized loan markets on an EVM-compatible platform while managing its tokenomics. We also learned that, in order to adapt to our ever-changing industry, the Qoda protocol needed to move to a multichain model.

As a result, the lessons of our experience have required us to make the decision that the Qoda deployment on Moonriver and the QODEX token are now deprecated. We have decided to launch a single token, QODA, that will represent ownership of the Qoda protocol across all deployed networks.

To acknowledge the support of early community members that took part in our Moonriver deployment, we will be rewarding QODEX holders via a QODA token retrodrop after the QODA Token Genesis Event (“TGE,” exact date not yet announced).

We keep all the info below without changes. Please note that it is not relevant anymore; this page is an archive page.
