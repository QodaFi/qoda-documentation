# Qoda's Vision

At Qoda Finance, we want to level the playing field so everyone has access to great financial services, even the ones that are typically reserved for the ultra-wealthy.

Qoda Loans brings fixed-rate money markets to everyone via Arbitrum. Our users have already traded loans as small as $1. Money market access in TradFi is limited to banks and big institutions, where the price of entry is in the millions of dollars. Not with Qoda Loans. Everyone trades on the same playing field, from the average Joe to a billionaire.

At Qoda Finance, we believe in the true spirit of decentralization. As long as you have a crypto wallet, our products will always be economically accessible to you. That’s our promise. 

Let’s see how exactly we plan to achieve it and what makes Qoda able to solve some existing TradFi and DeFi issues.
