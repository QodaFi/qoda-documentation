You can begin accruing veQODA by staking and locking your QODA tokens inside the staking contract. The primary motivation for veQODA is to incentivize long-term staking for users, but without explicitly locking users into staking for a minimum period of time. veQODA tokens are special ERC20 tokens with the following properties:"),(0,o.kt)("ol",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"veQODA reward tokens will accrue in real-time at a rate of 0.00004 veQODA tokens per 1 QODA token staked per block"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"There is a max cap of 100 total veQODA rewards total for each 1 QODA staked"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"veQODA tokens are non-transferrable from your wallet"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"If you unstake your QODA tokens, you wil lose ALL your earned veQODA tokens")),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Note: Currently, you must manually claim your veQODA tokens when you stake your QODA. You may claim veQODA as often as you wish, up to a per-block basis. veQODA tokens confer the following benefits, proportional to the total supply of veQODA tokens:"),(0,o.kt)("ol",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Right to claim issuance of new QODA tokens (QODA staking rewards)"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Right to claim protocol fees, denominated in GLMR (GLMR staking rewards)"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Governance/DAO voting rights")),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"wrapped-native-tokens"},"Wrapped Native Tokens"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,'Wrapped native tokens are ERC20 tokens (e.g., WETH, WGLMR, WMOVR) that represents the native token of the network (e.g., ETH, GLMR, MOVR etc) at a 1:1 ratio, allowing the native token to interact with smart contracts and decentralized applications on the network that require ERC20 compliant tokens. This "wrapping" is accomplished by depositing native token into a smart contract, which in return mints an equivalent amount of wrapped native token. This process is reversible, meaning wrapped native tokens can be "unwrapped" back into native tokens. Under the hood, Qoda uses the ERC20 standard for all lending and borrowing actions, including for native tokens, to provide a standardized interface.'))}c.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
